The hotrod you can by at a dealership, the Plymouth Prowler with its very
controversial appearance, is it ugly or is it beautiful? That all depends
on you, but one thing is sure, it will attract attention wherever you go.
This car has massive tires, 17in front tires and 21in rear tires, but with
only 253hp these tries are obviously only there for their appearance. This
car was intended to be a lightweight but it turned out a little heavier than
planned, still its weight is pretty light allowing the V6 engine to propel
it to 60mph in under 6 seconds. The previous prowler had a much weaker version
of the same engine and it took a full 7 seconds to sixty, but now with its
new engine it is now a real sports car. This vehicle has good handling and
is easy to control with its grippy tires and double wishbone suspension and
rear multi-link suspension. This car with its huge tires can fit much lager
brakes than the 13in rear and 11.1in front disks it comes with. In addition,
I am sure many people will likely add a supercharger or a turbo charger to
this car, after all, it is a hotrod. Customizing this car would probably
be fun especially since its lightweight means its performance can greatly
improve from small horsepower increases. This car is best for those who like
the hot rod look but do not have the time to build their own or just want
one that's safe and reliable enough for everyday street use.
