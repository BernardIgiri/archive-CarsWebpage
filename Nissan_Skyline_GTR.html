The replacement for the amazing Nissan Skyline GT-R, this new Skyline GT-R
looks bolder than the much softer GT-R that it is replacing. This car is
to Japan as the Corvette is to the US, it is a national icon, and anyone
who drives it will quickly see why. This Nissan comes with an excellent all
wheel drive system and four wheel steering to help provide this car with
its excellent handling. This car is claimed to only have 280hp because Japanese
officials think that 300hp is too much, but it is no secrete that this car
has more than that. That fact combined with the amazing tuning potential
(1000hp rumored to be possible) of this 8000rpm limited car results in a
vehicle the can outperform a <A HREF="C5_Corvette.html">Corvette</A> and
even challenge a <A HREF="Dodge_Viper.html">Dodge Viper</A> will outdoing
both in refinement and comfort. For those who like tuning, it will not cost
you much to make this car a lot faster. However, if you do not like tuning
it, it is good the way it comes for this highly refined sports car is readily
shows the mechanical genius of Nissan. Its high rpm engine has good torque
for an 8000rpm screamer; it will easily launch you past 60mph faster than
a Corvette could, if you know to drive it. Just be careful, because with
the traction of its AWD you just might wear down its clutch trying to drag
race from every stoplight you can find. In this car, you are not likely to
experience wheel spin unless the road conditions are bad (or if you launch
at 7000rpm). The handling in this car is amazing with that old oversteer
problem fixed, entry and exit into and out of the turns is wonderful although
its limits are not the highest in its class. Priced under $50,000 this car
is a steal and it will reward the owner who dares to crush the throttle.
This is one beautiful car, and it looks good too! If you have been searching
for great performance, a good ride, a bit of luxury, and all wheel drive
all in one package your search is over. Unfortunately, if your in America
you will have to wait until it is arrives here, and when it does it might
cost a bit more than it does in Japan.
