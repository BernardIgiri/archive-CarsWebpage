  Beyond the specs:
</H4>
<P ALIGN=Left>
John Hennessey heavily modified this <A HREF="Dodge_Viper.html">Dodge
Viper</A>, as you can see from the specs above the modifications were not
just useless visual add-ons. This Venom priced at an extremely low price
for a vehicle that is only .1 seconds slower to 60 and across the quarter
mile than the much more expensive <A HREF="Mclaren_F1.html">Mclaren F1</A>!
Its acceleration under 130mph is second only to the Mclaren F1! With such
massive torque it had to be fitted with special tires (which were technically
street legal) to prevent wheel spin and allow the testers to see it true
performance. The tires still did not help acceleration much though, and they
only affected off the line acceleration. The handling numbers are unmatched
by any production car ever and doing 75.1mph on the 600ft shalom required
the drivers to change direction from left to right suddenly every .9 seconds!
With so much awesome speed at such a bargain price I do not see why an enthusiast
would buy anything else priced above $160,000! However, with 200more hp and
160 more lbs.-ft of torque to add to the difficulty of driving a viper this
is not for the under-skilled driver (a.k.a. non-racecar driver). Still it
has the tires enlarged to 18 inches front and rear, the weight has been reduced
with carbon fiber and fully function front and rear spoilers added it should
make up for some of that extra power. This car is for the highly skilled
pure driving enthusiast who can resist the temptation to tap on the throttle
when the radar detector (a required device on a car this fast, in my opinion)
is warning you. Remember to exercise control when driving this car, after
all 100mph comes as fast as a Jeep Cherokee can hit 60mph.
