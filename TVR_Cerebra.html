  Beyond the specs:
</H4>
<P ALIGN=Left>
This is the British Viper, the virtual equivalent of the
<A HREF="Dodge_Viper.html">Dodge Viper's</A> price/performance we can enjoy
here in America. The differences are major however, where the Dodge Viper
comes with a truck derived V10 (converted from iron to alloy Lamborghini),
this TVR comes with a race derived V8. Another, difference is that while
the Vipers huge V10 offers a bass filled growl, the TVR has a lighter racy
snarl to it which is just as exciting. In addition, the Viper is tuned for
massive low-end torque, while the Cerbera is tuned for higher rpm power (although
it still has healthy torque). However, when you consider that the Cerbera
is weighs almost 1000lbs less and has only 30 less hp it is obvious why it
is much faster than a Dodge Viper. Also since it has narrower tires (8in
by 17in) and still has a healthy amount of torque (if not quite up to the
Viper's level) it can just as easily induce wheel spin. In addition, this
car comes with allot more luxury than a Dodge Viper, and there are no complaints
about comfort. Best of all (in my opinion) with a push of the button on its
remote the car is unlocked completely allowing a push of one of three different
a buttons to start and stop the engine and open the trunk. This car has a
more conservative look than a Viper; it is still an attractive car and is
easily identifiable as a TVR with those TVR rear lights. With the price of
Vipers in Europe, the Cerbera is obviously the better deal but in the US,
due to the cost of importing across the Atlantic the Viper offers a better
deal. This car combines neutral handling, Viper beating performance and a
race derived V8, at a Viper beating price (if you live in Europe). It also
comes in the slower 4.2 version with a smaller V8 and the slowest the Speed
Six version with an inline 6 engine.
